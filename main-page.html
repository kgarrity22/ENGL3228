                <h1>About the Project</h1>
                <h4>Our project focused on the recipes included in the novel <i>Sassafrass, Cypress & Indigo</i> by Ntozake Shange. We felt that the recipes were not only an important part of the novel, but also saw them as a way to engage people in conversation about the senses, Blackness, and joy. We decided to cook some of the recipes ourselves doing both a live zoom cooking show and a pre-recorded cooking experience. 
                    By combining a live and recorded experience, we thought that we could create a project that offered people a range of experiences. Here, we've included the videos of our two different approaches as well as the recipes that we cooked.

                <p>Ntozake Shange was an American playwright and poet. Much of her work is focused on Black feminism, race and Black power.
                She famously wrote <I>For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide / When the Rainbow is Enuf</I> and has won many
                awards for her writing.</p>

            <h3>Behind the Project</h3>
            <p class="norm-text">For our project, we did a live cooking show on zoom. We invited friends, family, and classmates and cooked three recipes from the novel. We discussed why we chose the recipes and focused on the role that Black women have historically played in cooking. At the end, we led the group through a mindful eating exercise in which we each tried our food, paying particular attention to our senses.</p>

                <h3>Behind the Project</h3>
                
                <p>Our project seeks to harness the sensory experience of cooking to engage with the senses, cultural tradition, and Black
                joy. Our video is a Zoom meeting in which we present a casual, conversation-based reflection on our experience of
                cooking Hildaâ€™s Turkey Hash, our own family traditions, the Gullah Geechee cultural heritage, and how Shange utilizes
                sensory material to depict Black joy.</p>
